Implement a program that determines whether a provided credit card number is valid according to Luhn’s algorithm.

$ python credit.py
Number: 378282246310005
AMEX
Specification
In credit.py in ~/pset6/credit/, write a program that prompts the user for a credit card number and then reports (via print) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number, exactly as you did in Problem Set 1, except that your program this time should be written (a) in Python and (b) in CS50 IDE.
So that we can automate some tests of your code, we ask that your program’s last line of output be AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n, nothing more, nothing less.
For simplicity, you may assume that the user’s input will be entirely numeric (i.e., devoid of hyphens, as might be printed on an actual card).
Best to use get_int or get_string from CS50’s library to get users’ input, depending on how you to decide to implement this one.
