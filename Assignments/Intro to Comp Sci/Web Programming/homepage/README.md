Ok, now to talk about the project, if you've bothered to read this far. It's a page about me and the things I vaguely know how to do. It's a nice self-confidence booster. index.html is the homepage, and each of the other html files is an advertisement of one of my talents. The images are visual aids I used to visualize my talents, and also to take up some empty space so it wasn't just all text, you know? The javascript files change the colors of the words "TALENTED" and "WORLD" in the website subtitle. styles.css has most of my styling details, and I used SASS.scss (and the subsequent SASS.css) to style my tables and the areas of the page with the "most talented man in the world" and "check out his many talents." Browse at your leisure, then hire me, I'm looking for work. tdjones@alum.mit.edu. Full current resume available upon request.
