Implement the functions in helpers.c such that a user can apply grayscale, sepia, reflection, or blur filters to their images.

The function grayscale should take an image and turn it into a black-and-white version of the same image.
The function sepia should take an image and turn it into a sepia version of the same image.
The reflect function should take an image and reflect it horizontally.
Finally, the blur function should take an image and turn it into a box-blurred version of the same image.
You should not modify any of the function signatures, nor should you modify any other files other than helpers.c.
