I call this project "Writers' Resources." I'm a writer, and when I was working on publishing my first novel, I struggled a lot to find 
the resources I needed to get the job done. A part of me wished that there was a centralized portal where I could find all the resources 
I needed, including agents to represent my work, editors to read through it, and publishers to publish it. Many professionals in the 
literary field are quite particular about the books they work on, so I oftentimes struggled to find agents who would particularly be 
interested in my work. 

The project is similar to a social network along the lines of LinkedIn, where users can build a profile of the works they've 
written/edited/represented/published, including genres and the titles of the works. This list is open to editing and expanding at any 
time when a user edits their profile. The profile also includes a summary, a brief pitch for professionals to sell themselves and why 
they are good at their craft. 

The home page presents the cream of the crop of the website: most prolific professionals, professionals with the most connections, and 
professionals with the most published works. Clicking on any of the users' pen names takes the user to the information page for that user, 
and they can see a summary of what that person works on (which is not limited, by the way, someone could be an editor, writer, and agent 
all at once.) There is also a button to send the other user a connection request, which will link the two accounts and (in a more advanced 
version of the website) allow the two professionals to communicate and coordinate on projects. If the user has already sent a request to 
that person, the website won't let them send another one. Alternatively, if the other user has sent the current user a connection request, 
there will be an option for the current user to simply accept the request and the two accounts will be connected.

If the user happens to click on their own pen name, it takes them to a modifiable version of their profile, and they can 
update it if they so choose. 

So that's the home, profile, and settings pages. Log in, log out, and register are self-explanatory. There are only a few more links to point out. 
The current user's pen name can be clicked to take them to their profile settings page. There's a link for "Find connections" which takes 
the user to a page listing all users in the site (unless they are already connected to the current user, have already sent the user a 
connection request, or the user has already sent them a connection request) along with information about their portfolio, such as which 
tasks they perform and how many titles they have to their name.

Then there's the "My Connection Requests" page, where a user can view their active connection requests, both the ones they've received,
and the ones they've sent. They can accept requests sent to them by other users, and see the users that still have not accepted their 
connection requests.

I perceive this as a foundation for further expansion. Allowing users to send messages would be especially useful, so users can coordinate 
projects. But you know how it is. You start out with an idea for a project, it's always way too huge, like unreasonably huge, and it has 
to be scaled back in some areas...

Still, was a lot of fun! Thanks for the class!
