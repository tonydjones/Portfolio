This is the app I designed for my freelance job. The Android version, anyway. The app pulls from multiple CSV files in order to
programmatically generate the information and how it is portrayed on the screen. I made it this way so that the people who commissioned 
the app (who are relatively tech illiterate) could easily just alter the CSV files in the app to change the information as necessary when they wish to update the app. 
They can also add new images and categories for information, all by altering the CSV files, no coding necessary. Most of the contact 
information is also interactive, ie clicking on a url will direct the phone to open the website, and the same with phone numbers, 
text lines, and e-mail addresses. There is also a search function which allows a user to search for the information they want from the app.
