Hey!

I currently work as a mental health counselor, so I wanted this project to be related to my work. So I made a therapy app.

My project is called CBT Aid, an Android app intended to make Cognitive behavioral therapy quick, easy, and readily accessible.

CBT is meant to be done daily, but many patients forget or don't make time to sit and do it. An app makes it possible to do therapy on the go, or anywhere at all.

I am one such person who forgets to do their CBT, so this app will be used by myself for quite some time. Nice to have a project where I make something really useful.

CBT is a scientifically proven therapeutic method for helping people cope with depression and anxiety and combat their harmful thoughts.

CBT Aid in parrticular takes users through an exercise of recording and combatting dysfunctional thoughts, one of the most common forms of CBT.

The app asks for the situation that caused the user to feel negative emotions, then asks for those emotions and how strongly they feel the emotions.

The app asks for the beliefs that motivated the negative emotions, and then prompts the user to consider what cognitive errors may or may not be present in their thinking.

Then, based on the cognitive errors the user selects, the app will specifically prompt them to come up with a rational response to their dysfunctional thoughts and beliefs.

Each cognitive error has a specific way to counteract it, which the app will instruct the user on how to do.

Finally, the user is prompted to reevaluate their emotions and how strongly they feel as compared to when they originally started.

A summary page is presented with all of the information that wass entered, and it is saved. Thoughts are stored according to the date and time they are entered and can be reviewed later if desired.

It's not a terrifically aesthetic app, I'll admit, but I decided to put my efforts into other areas. Making sure the back button always took the user to the previous prompt precisely,

making sure data is saved and restored to the view even after changing activities, making the questions programmatically produce correct grammar, and pages with detailed information

the user can readily access without losing their progress. It's meant for convenience and function, not aesthetic. Although another day of work and I could probably do that too, 

but I'm far more proud of the app's functionality than I would be of its appearance. And frankly that's all that really matters, because I made it for myself.
