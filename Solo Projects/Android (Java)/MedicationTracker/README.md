This is a medication tracker app I designed and developed for my current workplace, a substance use treatment center. Because of the population we work with, we have to track all of the clients' medications
and when they take and refill them. Currently this is done entirely by hand at my program, which is prone to frequent errors, and then the data later has to be copied over to an excel 
spreadsheet. Seeing the inefficiency and inconvenience of this method, I offered to my supervisor to develop an Android application that would do basically all of the work for us and make 
our jobs easier.

The primary loop of the app involves recording when a client enters the program and what medications they enter with, recording every time the client takes medications or refills medications, 
recording changes in the prescriptions, keeping count of the number of doses of controlled medications such as suboxone and xanax, recording when prescriptions are discontinued, and 
recording when the client leaves the program. In addition, the app is able to generate spreadsheets of all the data or subsets of the data, edit the records, delete records, and has 
optional password protection with certain functions locked behind an administrator password.
