This is a video game I coded for the Unity engine. Relatively simple, but it was fun to start from scratch and build a game from the ground up... 
Sort of. I used a lot of free assets from the Unity store: the background, ship models, particle effects, and lasers. But the code in C# 
is all from me. Turns out there's a lot more that goes into a video game than one might think. It's the little details that make a game 
playable. Making sure the lasers only interact with the enemy, making the player ship appear to "blink" when it took damage, properly placed 
particle effects for when the lasers hit the enemy ship and when the ships explode, making a translucent shield and removing it after taking 
damage. It wasn't super difficult, there were just a lot of details. It was actually really fun to put it together and code it all. All in 
all, good stuff.
